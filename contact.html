      <h1>Contact me</h1>
      <p>
        Hey, this is me, a poor guy who wants to take good photos, but fails to do so. If you are also interested in taking photographs or traveling, don't hesitate to contact me. I am also learning
        about portrait photography! I will be really happy if you allow me to capture the best moments of you. Although I don't have much experience and my skills are still very immature, I believe I
        will take some good photos one day. "I will keep working hard and make progress each day." Just like the saying I have remembered since I was a child.
      </p>

      <p>
        Besides photography, I also have a lot of different hobbies. I enjoy working out at the gym. I usually go to NCRB twice a week for a workout. I play badminton on other days even though I am
        just a beginner. I also enjoy cooking food as I miss my hometown food after I came to the US. I have tried a lot different dishes. My specialty is sweet and sour pork ribs. I will make that
        dish once every month. If you come to my home, I will treat you with that. I am sure that you will like it.
