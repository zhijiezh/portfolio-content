    <h1>Places to go</h1>
		<p id="main-content">One of my dreams is to travel all over the world and take photographs everywhere. I have taken a lot of photos in Japan. Tokyo, Osaka, Kyoto, and Sapporo all left me with a deep impression. Unluckily, I didn't get a chance to take photos of Mount Fuji. In the United States, I have taken photos of cherry blossoms in DC, Route One in California, and night views in Chicago and New York. I hope I can get some nice photos for the wonderful Autumn in Michigan. One pity in my short photography career is that when I want to take a nice photo of Mount Reiner, the mountain is completely hidden behind the cloud.</p>

    <p>There are also a lot of places that I haven't been to. There are a lot of places that are on my wishlists. Some of them are relatively easy to go to. Like Cancun in Mexico, Porto Reco, Alaska, and the Great Canyon. Those are the places that I would like to travel to in the coming years. I want to go to Iceland to see the Aurora Borealis. I want to see Niagara Falls. I want to experience the polar day in Antarctica. Those places are not that easy to go to. I will save money and try to find a long vacation that can help fulfill my dreams.</p>
