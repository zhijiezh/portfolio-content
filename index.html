      <h1>Zhijie Zhao's <br> photography blog</h1>
      <p>Hello, I am Zhijie Zhao, currently a second-year Master's student at the School of Information, University of Michigan. My interests include photography, front-end development, game development, and UX design. This is the website to display my photographs. </p>

      <p>I have started taking photos since my junior year. At first, I was using my phone. It was a Huawei P20 pro at that time. I also bought a DJI Osmo Mobile 3, which is a mobile phone stabilizer to help me make Vlog. During that time I also learned about video editing. Through that process, I find myself more interested in static photography. I started to use my father's camera to shoot photos. It was a Canon 5DIII, a full-frame DSLR. That was a very professional machine. My father used that machine to shoot beautiful scenery of wildlife. He loves taking photos of birds and flowers. However, I am more focused on humanity photography. So I bought a 50mm f1.2 lens for him (and of course for myself). I started to learn photography by using that camera and that lens.</p>
      <p>This is the camera I use. Fujifilm XS-10.</p>

      <p>I didn't take my father's camera to the United States, so I bought my first camera - a Fujifilm XS-10. Fuji is an interesting brand that had developed a  lot of interesting filters for photography. They can give your photos a "premium feel". I like this kind of feeling very much. Currently, all of my photos posted on this website is through this camera.</p>
